# Websocket Notes

> A real time note taking application using Websockets and Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## To Do
1. Fix bug with log in functionality (sometimes only one user will show as logged in even though there are two)
2. Move logic from App into external utility functions
